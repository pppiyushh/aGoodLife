# aGoodLife

One of the few things which isn't taught as much as it should be I feel is how to lead a good life.
I understand we are programmers and we try make good tech, but what we'll do with the good tech if that doesn't make your life good.

I won't try to make this some work-life balance repo, but will list some of things I've learnt on way and would love to share it to you. First of all nothing is black and white,it's always some shade of gray. There will be exceptions to every situtation, nothing I menion here is absolute will work in general. 
Few things to keep in mind always(with exceptions):
- Prirotize yourself.
- Get a good sleep.
- Its okay to enjoy your solitude.
- Get bored, don't always try to chase something or scroll through social media.
- Understand the situation and change accordingly.
- Dont make your after good on the cost of ruining your current life.


I'll give examples to some of the exceptions for better clarity.
- **Prirotize yourself**: Not when you are going for a cause bigger than yourself.
- **Check from where your happiness is coming from**: (Gives you better clarity) Is it an ego boost? Is it the satisfaction? This whole scenario is kinda long, will complete it later.

Will write more as I get more free time.
