# aGoodLife

One of the few things which isn't taught as much as it should be I feel is how to lead a good life.
I understand we are programmers and we try make good tech, but what we'll do with the good tech if that doesn't make your life good.

I work try to make this some work-life balance repo, but will list some of things I've learnt on way and would love to share it to you.
